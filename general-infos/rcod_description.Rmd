The course aims at providing technical skills about coding/scripting
aspects for data analysis and to manage persistent data storage of
sources and results involved in analysis. On the one side, the R framework is 
illustrated. The goal is to deal first with essential notions about data 
structures and control structures of R, then to learn how to code with modern 
and state-of-the-art R packages.  


## Course Structure

The **R Coding** part of the course aims at teaching **R Programming**.  
The state-of-the-art and modern R packages are presented from a very practical 
point of view, throughout R tutorials on each main topic.
