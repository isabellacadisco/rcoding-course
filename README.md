# R Coding

*Overview*

The course aims at providing technical skills about coding/scripting
aspects for data analysis and to manage persistent data storage of
sources and results involved in analysis. On the one side, the Python
programming language and the R framework are illustrated. The goal is to
deal with essential notions about data structures and control structures
of both Python and R. On the other side, the goal is to present the core
notions of relational databases, such as keys, integrity, and
primary/foreign key constraints, as well as the SQL language for data
definition, manipulation, and query. Recent and innovative NoSQL
solutions are also discussed, with special focus on a document-oriented
system called MongoDB.

The **R Coding** part of the course aims at teaching **R Programming**,
focusing on how to code with modern and state-of-the-art R packages.
