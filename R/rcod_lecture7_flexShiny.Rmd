### Overview

By adding **Shiny** to a flexdashboard, you can create dashboards that enable 
viewers to change underlying parameters and see the results immediately, 
or that update themselves incrementally as their underlying data changes 
(see reactiveFileReader and reactivePoll). This is done by adding 
**runtime: shiny** to a standard flexdashboard and then adding one or more 
input controls and/or reactive expressions that dynamically drive the 
appearance of the components within the dashboard.

Using Shiny with flexdashboard turns a static R Markdown report into an 
Interactive Document. Itâ€™s important to note that interactive documents 
need to be deployed to a Shiny Server to be shared broadly (whereas static 
R Markdown documents are standalone web pages that can be attached to emails 
or served from any standard web server).

Note that the **shinydashboard** package provides another way to create 
dashboards with Shiny.
