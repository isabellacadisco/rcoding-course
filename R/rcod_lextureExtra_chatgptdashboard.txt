We want to build a flexdashboard using chatgpt.

Start by creating an empty .Rmd then use the chatgpt prompt:
- be as precise as possible in your questions
- start simple and build the code progressively


(1)
I want to build a dashboard in R to analyze the iris dataset. 
I want to use the flexdashboard package. Please, create an empty .Rmd 
template with a just a YAML header and a sidebar.

(2)
Now add also two columns to this and correct the YAML.

(3)
Now add a check box input to the sidebar to select the iris species.

(4)
Now add a ggplot graph into the first column plotting the petal length vs
the petal width for the species selected by the input.  


(5)
Now add to the second coluumn a ggplot graph into the first column 
plotting the boxplot of sepal length for the different species and coloring 
also by species.
