### Overview

The goal of flexdashboard is to make it easy to create interactive 
dashboards for R, using R Markdown:

- Use **R Markdown** to publish a group of related data visualizations 
  as a dashboard
- Support for a **wide variety of components** including htmlwidgets; base, 
  lattice, and grid graphics; tabular data; gauges and value boxes; and 
  text annotations
- Flexible and easy to specify **row and column-based layouts**. Components 
  are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display 
  on mobile devices
- **Storyboard** layouts for presenting sequences of visualizations and 
  related commentary
- Optionally use **Shiny** to drive visualizations dynamically
- Optionally use **bslib** to easily customize main colors, fonts, and more
