## RMardown

So far, you’ve learned the tools to get your data into R, tidy it into a
form convenient for analysis, and then understand your data through 
transformation, visualization and modelling. However, it doesn’t matter 
how great your analysis is unless you can explain it to others: 
you need to **communicate** your results.  

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. 

You can use a single R Markdown file to both  
- save and execute code, and  
- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience.  

R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the 
computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results 
are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports 
dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.  

There are three basic components of an R Markdown document: 
the metadata, text, and code. The metadata is written between 
the pair of three dashes ---. The syntax for the metadata is YAML 
(YAML Ain’t Markup Language, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), 
so sometimes it is also called the YAML metadata or the YAML frontmatter.  

The body of a document follows the metadata. The syntax for text 
(also known as prose or narratives) is Markdown.  


### How to Create an RMarkdown Document

Open a new .Rmd file in the RStudio IDE by going to File > New File > R Markdown.  


### RMarkdown Workflow

1. Open a new .Rmd file in the RStudio IDE by going to 
   File > New File > R Markdown  
2. Embed code in chunks. Run code by line, by chunk, or all at once.
3. Write text and add tables, figures, images, and citations  
   Format with Markdown syntax or the RStudio Visual Markdown Editor  
4. Set output format(s) and options in the YAML header. Customize themes or 
   add parameters to execute or add interactivity with Shiny  
5. Save and render the whole document. Knit periodically to preview your 
   work as you write  
6. Share your work!  


### Rendering

The usual way to compile an R Markdown document is to click the Knit 
button as shown in Figure 2.1, and the corresponding keyboard shortcut 
is Ctrl + Shift + K (Cmd + Shift + K on macOS). Under the hood, RStudio 
calls the function rmarkdown::render() to render the document in a new 
R session. Please note the emphasis here, which often confuses R 
Markdown users. Rendering an Rmd document in a new R session means 
that none of the objects in your current R session (e.g., those you 
created in your R console) are available to that session. Reproducibility 
is the main reason that RStudio uses a new R session to render your 
Rmd documents: in most cases, you may want your documents to continue 
to work the next time you open R, or in other people’s computing 
environments.  

If you must render a document in the current R session, you can also 
call rmarkdown::render() by yourself, and pass the path of the Rmd 
file to this function. The second argument of this function is the 
output format, which defaults to the first output format you specify 
in the YAML metadata (if it is missing, the default is html_document).  

There are two types of output formats in the rmarkdown package: 
documents, and presentations.  


### Learning RMarkdown

To master RMarkdown follow 
[RMarkdown the Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)  

If you prefer a video introduction to R Markdown, I recommend that 
you check out the website https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com, and watch 
the videos in the “Get Started” section, which cover the basics of 
R Markdown.  


## Headers 

To create a header to an RMarkdown document you can `#`. 
The number of `#` used represents the level of the header.  


## Text

Text can simply be add writing normally as a text document.  

**Bold text** is added with `**some text**` and *italic text* with `*some text*`.  

One can also adapts the text to the output of an R command, such as
'nrow(cars)' and 'ncol(cars)'. To include the output of an R command 
within the text, use backticks and r. 
For example... the iris dataset contains `r nrow(iris)` rows and 
`r ncol(iris)` columns.  


## Comments

To add comments to an RMarkdown document you can use `<!-- some text -->`, as
in html.  


## Chunks

Chunks are the places where code is used and they are created with the 
following syntax  

` ```{r chunk_name} # some code ``` `

Chunks can be inserted quickly using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I 
(macOS: Cmd + Option + I), or via the Insert menu in the editor toolbar.  

Each chunk has a name. The name must be in the form 'r + some text', 
for instance 'r data'. Within a chunk you can write R commands.

```{r data, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
str(iris)
```

Chunks have options that controls how r commands and outputs are displayed
in the html document. The are few fundamental options that are always used:  
- `eval`: whether to evaluate a code chunk.  
- `echo`: whether to echo the source code in the output document 
(someone may not prefer reading your smart source code but only results).    
- `include`: whether to include anything from a code chunk in the output document.  
- `warning`, `message`, and `error`: whether to show warnings, messages, and 
errors in the output document.  
- `fig.width` and `fig.height`: the (graphical device) size of R plots in inches.   
- `out.width` and `out.height`: the output size of R plots in the output document.  
- `fig.align`: the alignment of plots. It can be 'left', 'center', or 'right'.   
- `fig.cap`: the figure caption.  

```{r packages, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Figures

By default, figures produced by R code will be placed immediately after 
the code chunk they were generated from.  

```{r plot, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, xlab = "Sepal Lenght", ylab = "Petal Lenght")
```


## Statistics within Chunks

One can simply perform statistical analysis within code chunks.

```{r summary, echo = TRUE}
summary(iris)
```

Math expression can be inserted by surrounding text into $.  

I now want to fit the linear regression model to my data of the form  

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$$

To do this, I simply use the function `lm`.

```{r lm, echo = TRUE}
model <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = iris)
```

The model output is the following:  

```{r lm out, echo = TRUE}
summary(model)
```

We see that $\hat{\beta}_0$ is `r round(model$coefficients[1],2)` while the 
slope is equal to `r round(model$coefficients[2],2)`.
