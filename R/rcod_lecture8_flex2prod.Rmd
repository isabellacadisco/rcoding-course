### Static HTML

Flexdashboards without Shiny interactive components are just HTML pages
hence can be shared as any other basic HTML file: attaching 
it to and e-mail, sending as documents into your business chat or even
uploading it to a website.    

One of the most efficient way to share you dashboard is indeed to host it
on the web (for free) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  

Follow these simple steps to deploy your HTML Flexdashboard to the web:  

1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new **public** repository  
2. From the green code tab of your new repo, copy the HTTPS link   
3. Locally, through RStudio, create a new **RStudio Project** from Version 
Control and link it to your GitHub repo using the HTTPS link  
4. Place your *flexdashboard.Rmd* file into the project folder, knit, commit 
and push the new files to GitHub   
5. From the settings of your GitHub repo, go to **Pages** and activate them  
6. Your dashboard is now available at 
https://user-name.github.io/repo-name/dashboard-name.html

### Reactive Rmd

Using Shiny with flexdashboard turns a static R Markdown report into an 
interactive document. Itâ€™s important to note that interactive documents 
cannot be shared as static HTML files, but need to be deployed as a service
to a web server.   

The easiest way is through 
[Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) 
or directly via [Shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) (but the
free version limits you to 5 dashboards and small online time). 
Deploying your dashboard allows you to share it broadly with no limits.  

Follow these simple steps to deploy your Rmd Flexdashboard via Shiny Server:  

1. Install **Shiny R package** as admin  
2. Install **Shiny Server** (once installed it starts automatically)
3. Install all the **R packages** required by your flexdashboard as an admin 
(for example, on Ubuntu shell run 
`sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('package_name', repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')\""`
)  
4. To host the app just copy the directory of your dashboard to 
**/srv/shiny-server/**. At this point, the Shiny service automatically points
to the .Rmd of the dashboard and deploys hosts it on 
http://localhost:3838/dashboard-directory-name/  


Notes:  

The default configuration file is installed at 
**/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf** if it doesn't already exist.  
The default configuration creates a single server listening on port 3838, 
serving any application contained within **/srv/shiny-server/** at the root 
URL (/).

[Shiny Server Basic Installation Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/)
and the 
[Shiny Server Administrator Guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/).  


To host your app to the web you need some host web server as
